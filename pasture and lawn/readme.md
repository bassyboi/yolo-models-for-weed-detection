# Lawn Weed Detection AI

## Overview
Lawn Weed Detection AI is an open-source solution for identifying and managing lawn weeds using computer vision. It helps homeowners, lawn care professionals, and groundskeepers efficiently target weeds.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Detection**: Uses a camera with a Raspberry Pi for real-time weed identification.
- **Efficient and Lightweight**: Runs on low-power devices like Raspberry Pi.
- **Versatile Use**: Suitable for lawns, parks, golf courses, and sports fields.
- **Open Source**: Customizable to suit different needs.

## System Requirements
- **Raspberry Pi** or compatible computer
- **Camera Module**: Raspberry Pi Camera or USB webcam
- **Python 3.7+**
- **TensorFlow Lite**: For edge deployment
- **Dependencies**: Install via `requirements.txt`

## Installation
1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lawn-weed-detection-ai.git
   cd lawn-weed-detection-ai
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run Application**
   ```bash
   python lawn_weed_detection.py
   ```

## Usage
- **Real-time Detection**: Displays lawn area and marks weeds.
- **Data Collection**: Optionally save images for training or analysis.

## Supported Weed Types
Currently supports:
- Dandelions
- Clover
- Crabgrass

To add more weeds, retrain the model with additional data.

## Training the Model
1. **Collect and Annotate Images**
2. **Train Model**
   ```bash
   python train.py --data your_dataset --epochs 50
   ```

## Pre-trained Model
**YOLO 11** is available on GitHub: [YOLO 11 Model](https://github.com/yourusername/yolo-11/releases/download/v1.0/yolo11.pt)
